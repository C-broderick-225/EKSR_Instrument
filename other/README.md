The message sent from the Fardriver controller over the BLE/serial link is documented (to as much as I could figure out) in the [FarDriver_Serial_Messages.pdf](./FarDriver_Serial_Messages.pdf) file.

The [main.py](./main.py) file contains a small python program to help in visualizing the incoming messages.
